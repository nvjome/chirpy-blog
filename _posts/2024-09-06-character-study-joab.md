I attend a Bible study group at a local church, and we are currently in a series of studies on various individuals from the Bible, with each person leading a study on a person of their choosing. I recently read through 2 Samuel in the chronological Bible reading plan I have been following and Joab stood out to me as an interesting person, so I decided to do my study on him.

Rather than have a wall of text about what I think of Joab, this is the outline I used when leading the study, with context for each passage, and some questions I used to guide the group's conversation. Feel free to follow along and learn a little about Joab. The passages are cut down to just those that included Joab, so I would highly recommend reading all of 2 Samuel to get the full story!

## Who Was Joab?

Joab was a nephew of David, son of David’s sister Zeruiah. He was appointed commander of the army after he led the attack against the Jebusites, a Cannanite tribe that was occupying Israel. Under David, he led Israel to great military victories against the Syrians, Arameans, Ammonites, and Edomites. He is first mentioned in 1 Samuel 26, with additional accounts appearing in 2 Samuel,1 Kings, and 1 Chronicles.

## Context

Saul has just been killed in battle with the Philistines. Abner, commander of Saul’s army, makes Ish-Bosheth, son of Saul, king of Israel. The tribe of Judah, however, is loyal to David, and war breaks out.

## Readings

Abner and his men meet with Joab and his men. A fight breaks out and Abner’s men are defeated, but Abner kills Joab’s brother Asahel. Abner later betrays Ish-Bosheth, and travels to meet with David.

**Read: [2 Samuel 3:12-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20samuel%202%3A12-30&version=NIV)**

David sleeps with Uriah’s wife Bathsheba, then attempts to cover it up by getting Uriah drunk, thinking Uriah would sleep with Bathsheba. This plan fails, so David commands Joab to put Uriah at the front lines at the siege of Rabbah so he would be killed.

**Read: [2 Samuel 11:14-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2011%3A14-18&version=NIV)**

Absalom (son of David) kills Amnon (another son of David) because Amnon raped their sister Tamar. He flees in fear of being punished by David. Joab then makes a plan to convince David to let Absalom return.

**Read: [2 Samuel 14:1-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2014%3A1-21&version=NIV)**

Absalom rebels and recruits Amasa and his men to help him overthrow David. David fled Jerusalem with Joab and those still loyal to him. Absalom and his army pursue David, and the two armies fight in the forest of Ephraim.

**Read: [2 Samuel 18:5-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2018%3A5-17&version=NIV) and [19:1-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2019%3A1-8&version=NIV)**

After Absalom dies, David appoints Amasa as commander of the army. David then commands Amasa to put down another rebellion led by Sheba, son of Bikri. Joab meets with Amasa on his way to fight Sheba.

**Read: [2 Samuel 20:8-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2020%3A8-11&version=NIV)**

When David is very old, Adonijah (yet another son of David) plots to steal the throne from Solomon (still yet another son of David), and recruits Joab. David then gives his dying commands to Solomon.

**Read: [1 Kings 2:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%202%3A5-6&version=NIV) and [28-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%202%3A28-35&version=NIV)**

## Discussion Questions

- What are Joab’s strengths?
- What are Joab’s weaknesses?
- Why does Joab want to bring Absalom back after Amnon is killed?
- Why does Joab disobey David by killing Absalom? Do you think his actions were justified?
- Why does David appoint Amasa over Joab? How would Joab perceive that?
- Why did Joab join Adonijah instead of remaining loyal to David and Solomon?
- Do you think David/Solomon was justified in killing Joab?
