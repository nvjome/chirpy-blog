I attend a Bible study group at a local church, and we will soon be doing a series of studies on various individuals from the Bible, with each person leading a study on a person of their choosing. I recently read through 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles in the chronological Bible reading plan I have been following, and Joab stood out to me as person I might like to lead a study on.

## Who is Joab?

Joab was David's nephew, the son of David's sister Zeruiah ([1 Chronicles 2:13-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chronicles%202%3A13-17&version=NIV)), and the commander of David's army. Joab first appears in 2 Samuel, with additional accounts in 1 Kings and 1 Chronicles.

In 2 Samuel 2, Saul had just been killed by the Philistines, and his son Ish-Bosheth was declared king over Israel by Saul's commander Abner. "The tribe of Judah, however, remained loyal to David." ([2 Samuel 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+2%3A10&version=NIV))
