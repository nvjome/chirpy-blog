I attend a Bible study group at a local church, and we will soon be doing a series of studies on various individuals from the Bible, with each person leading a study on a person of their choosing. I recently read through 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles in the chronological Bible reading plan I have been following, and Joab stood out to me as person I might like to lead a study on.
