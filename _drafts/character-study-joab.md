I attend a Bible study group at a local church, and we will soon be doing a series of studies on various individuals from the Bible, with each person leading a study on a person of their choosing. I recently read through 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles in the chronological Bible reading plan I have been following, and Joab stood out to me as person I might like to lead a study on.

## Who is Joab?

Joab appears in the Bible during the reign of King David over Israel. He was David's nephew, the son of David's sister Zeruiah ([1 Chronicles 2:13-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chronicles%202%3A13-17&version=NIV)).
