Do people even read blogs anymore? I don't know, but I thought it might be fun to build one to learn something new. I plan to use this place to post information about my projects and other happenings. Mostly for my own learning and fun, but if somebody else stumbles across this and find some semblance of interest in it, that's cool too.

I work as an electrical engineer and have interests in electronics tinkering, embedded Linux, microcontroller programming, video games, hunting, fishing, shooting sports, handloading, cycling, music, Christian theology, and whatever else catches my eye on any given day. So I don't really know what all will end up here.

I know it's pretty bare right now, hopefully that will change soon!
